# How to Contribute?

If you just don't like to follow any guidelines we will appreciate your `PR` anyway but here is the general routine from having an idea to `PR` submission:

- [Search for an issue](https://github.com/incerta/spadar/issues) related to your idea
- If you don't find one, [create it](#create-issue) or make a PR right away for simple fixes
- If you want to work on it yourself, please leave a comment with an approximate estimate of when it could be done
- Don't worry if you miss your deadline, just leave a comment with a re-estimate or do nothing if you are not planning to work on this anytime soon
- If you find an issue, please check if someone might already be working on it before rushing into a solution
- [Create PR](#pull-request) when you finished or did some partial progress

## Create Issue

Please try to use recommended format for issues below:

- **Title**: Start with a concise and informative summary of the issue. It should give a clear idea of what the problem is.
- **Description**: Provide a detailed description of the issue. Explain what is happening, what you expected to happen, and why this is a problem. If possible, include steps to reproduce the issue.
- **Labels**: Use labels to categorize the issue. This can help other contributors understand the issue's priority, type (bug, feature request, etc.), or which part of the project it relates to.
- **Screenshots**: If the issue is a bug and it's possible to capture it visually, include screenshots or GIFs. This can help others understand exactly what's going wrong.
- **Environment**: Include information about your environment, like the browser or OS where the issue occurs, the version of the project you're using, etc.
- **Possible Solution**: If you have an idea for how to fix the issue, include it here. This isn't required, but it can help move the discussion forward.

Remember, the goal of the issue description is to provide enough information to others so they can understand the issue and potentially work on a fix.

## Pull Request

Our `dev` branch is default for PR's submissions.

### Pull Request Format

- **Title**: Start with a brief, clear summary of the changes. Use imperative mood, like "Add feature X" or "Fix bug in Y".
- **Description**: Provide a detailed description of the changes. Explain why you made the changes, how they address the issue, and any potential side effects.
- **Link Issues**: If the PR is related to any open issues, link them in the description. This helps to track the progress of the issue.
- **Testing**: Describe how the changes have been tested or provide steps for reviewers to test the changes.

### Commit Message Format

Just use imperative mood like "Add feature X" or "Fix bug in Y". The commit format example:

```
Short message at the top

- Some specifics listed using dash `-` symbol
- Usually we want to see separate commit for each distinct microtask
```
