# What is all about?

It's an experimentation platform for software development automation boundaries definition using AI language models. The ultimate goal is to have ability generate humanly readable statically typed documented and well tested frontend/backend codebase with infrastructure config by the simple request like "build me twitter using typescript" with ability to effectively change the generated or humanly written app by automation.

We are going to do it through creation of numerous cli tools powered by AI language model API. We want to develop unified manner of using this cli tools which should be convenient in their orchestration. We prioritizing the goal of simplification of frontend development job and reducing it to just requirements clarification and generated solution refinement â€“ checking if everything is clear, working and humanly readable.

# Glossary

Description of the current project terminology. Writing documentation one should wrap following terms in backticks: ``

`bot` - is command line interface that uses file or directory path as an input and has a different output depending on the bot type
`bot-memo` - the description of the `bot` in `markdown` format
`bot-name` - name of the specific `bot`
`bot-cli` - command line interface of a `bot`
`reactor` - the place in the project file structure where bot outputs are saved
`app` - application of the `bot` output
`app-memo` - the description of the `app` in `markdown` format
`app-name` - name of the specific `app`

# Bot types

Here we are listing each type of the `bot` with brief description. Each bot has `-bot` suffix in its name. The source of each bot stored at `src/bot/${bot-name}` directory and has its own `README.md` documentation file

`refiner-bot` - takes any `.md` file path as an input and outputs with refined version of the file
`clarity-bot` - takes `app-memo` as an input and outputs with refined version

# Project file structure

Paths are defined relative to the root of the project (repository)

## Project root files

`package.json` - nodejs dependencies (`dependencies`, `devDependencies`) and development commands (`scripts`)
`.env` - environment variables file `.env` (the file in the `.gitignore`)
`.env.example` - example of `.env` content
`node_modules` - installed nodejs dependencies source
`tmp` - just directory in `.gitignore` for saving temporary stuff related to the project

## `reactor`

Directory where newly generated code is scoped by the `app-name` (the dir is in the `.gitignore`). We don't want to use git for tracking changes of the newly generated code but usage of the nested repositories is not forbidden

`reactor/${app-name}/initial-app-memo.md` - `app-memo` that written by human initially or generated by another `bot` that not used `app-description` as an input
`reactor/${app-name}/refined-app-memo.md` - description refined by some `bot`
`reactor/${app-name}/${bot-name}` - directory for storing logs and other files related to the `bot` actions

## `src`

The directory where source code of the `bots` is stored alongside with `bot-cli` implementation

`src/types.ts` - the project domain specific types
`src/bots/${bot-name}` - a `bot` source directory
`src/cli` - the directory cli source code
`src/AI` - the directory where artificial intelligence API adapter
